# Vue Project Setup Guide

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (npm is included with Node.js)

## Installation Steps

### 1. Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Kaumudi-Kulkarni/SE-Project.git
cd SE-Project
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Using npm:
```sh
npm install
```
Using yarn:
```sh
yarn install
```

### 3. Run the Development Server
Using npm:
```sh
npm run dev
```
Using yarn:

This will start the local development server. The default URL is usually `http://localhost:5173/`.
